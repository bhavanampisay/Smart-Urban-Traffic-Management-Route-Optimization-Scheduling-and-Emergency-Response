In today's rapidly urbanizing world, traffic congestion and road safety have become
Major challenges in metropolitan areas. Our project presents an AI-powered Urban
Traffic Management System that leverages image processing, machine learning, and
reinforcement learning to:

Predict and optimize traffic congestion using real-time vehicle detection.

Dynamically control traffic lights based on current traffic conditions to reduce wait times.

Identify accident hotspots and suggest optimal routes for emergency vehicles.

By integrating intelligent algorithms with video analytics, our system aims to enhance traffic flow, reduce delays, and ensure safer, faster urban mobility.
